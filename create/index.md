title: "Create"

We chose to use a human centric approach to artificial intelligence, using machine learning to provide data and context that can used creatively. The tool we chose to use is PoseNet, a machine learning model trained using computer vision to provide estimation of a human subject's skeletal pose. We also trained a neural network to classify specific dance poses.

As a team we chose to use p5js and ml5 as our artistic platform. We are in the process of bringing to this site so others can try it for themselves. Check back soon!
