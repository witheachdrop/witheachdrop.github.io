**With each drop** is an interactive visual poem, an ode to the intimate relationship people around the world have with water. Through the use of p5js, ml5 and Posenet, With each drop allows individuals to interact with a sensorial representation of the poem through movement and dance. Each person will be able to move, influence and manipulate the poem as they see fit. The poem itself is nonlinear, supported by graphic, audio and music cues. Each performance of the poem will be unique, depending on the tempo, movement and choices of the individual, contributing a powerful additional movement, or voice, to the conversation.
